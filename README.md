 I have just completed a dynamic dashboard analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) across different states of India. 

Key Insights from the Project:

1. Area-wise AQI Overview: Comprehensive breakdown of air quality across various states, highlighting regional trends.

2. Top 3 Polluted Cities: Identified the most polluted cities, raising awareness about the need for environmental action.

3. Least Polluted City: Shone a spotlight on the cleanest city, showcasing effective environmental practices.

4. AQI Trend (2015-2020): Visualized how air quality has evolved over the years, providing insights into long-term trends.

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, combining data analysis with powerful visual storytelling. Looking forward to diving deeper into data-driven insights!
